A `Product` is an expected result after building or installation of a package.

Examples of `Product`s include `LibraryProduct`, `ExecutableProduct` and
`FileProduct`.  All `Product` types must define the following minimum set of
functionality:

* `locate(::Product)`: given a `Product`, locate it within the wrapped `Prefix`
  returning its location as a string

* `satisfied(::Product)`: given a `Product`, determine whether it has been
  successfully satisfied (e.g. it is locateable and it passes all callbacks)

* `variable_name(::Product)`: return the variable name assigned to a `Product`

* `repr(::Product)`: Return a representation of this `Product`, useful for
  auto-generating source code that constructs `Products`, if that's your thing.

refers to `"/lib/libnettle.so"`, the "directory" would be "/lib", and the

multiple libnames, as some software projects change the libname based on the

`foo_exe` and `libbar`.  If any `Product` object cannot be satisfied (e.g.
`LibraryProduct` objects must be `dlopen()`-able, `FileProduct` objects must
exist on the filesystem, etc...) this method will error out.  Ensure that you
have used `install()` to install the binaries you wish to write a `deps.jl`
